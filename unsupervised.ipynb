You will need to write an end-to-end classifier that takes in training inputs, training outputs, and testing inputs. It should return predicted outputs for the testing outputs. \n",

    "\n",
    "In lecture, Zico mentioned that a common technique when using RBF features is to use KMeans to select RBF centers, which help make nonlinear decision boundaries.  With a proper choice of parameters, this can do quite well on this task. Using an SVM with RBF features as described in lecture (with the median trick) and KMeans++, you can achieve full credit on this problem (our implementation achieves 81-82% accuracy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, similar to the last contest, you are free to do whatever you'd like and do not have to adhere to this solution. We have tried multiple other methodologies, which are also able to break the 80% barrier, and some of which are quite simple. With proper domain knowledge, you could even do this with just feature engineering and vanilla SVM!\n",

    "### Specification: \n",
    "* Your function will receive the a labeled training set, and an unlabeled testing set, in the same format as that provided in this notebook. \n",
    "* There are no restrictions other than 1) you cannot use sklearn (we found it to be largely unhelpful, so you aren't missing much) and 2) you are restricted to the computing capabilities on Autolab. \n",
    "* You will receive full credit if you get above an 80% accuracy score. You will receive a scaled score for every % point you get above predicting the most frequent training example (e.g. predicting 1 for everything). \n",
    "* We've taken care of almost all the plumbing code for you in this assignment, so you just need to worry about predict_faces. "
